OpenGl Showing a Bathroom Countertop

All files except the Utilities folder, need to be contained in a single folder in order for the project to work in your C++ IDE. The Utilities folder needs to be separate from this project folder in order to upload the graphics properly.

Creating this helped me realize how difficult it is to incorporate graphics in design, so I also gained a new appreciation for graphic designers while designing this bathroom countertop.  When designing the scene I began looking at my own bathroom countertop, and took seven objects that I saw, and organized them in a way that would allow me to easily recreate the countertop on my computer using OpenGL.  Normally for me, when designing something like a website, or any kind of plan, it helps when I do some sketches to get a basic idea of how I want the final product to look like.

When developing new projects, I usually break them down into a step by step process, starting with the design phase, then moving it into development, by breaking the program down into its smallest componets, and starting there to ensure it works with lots of testing to ensure everything is working as intended.

Using computer science is my main goal, because I want to be a full stack developer, creating projects from the ground up, giving users lots of user friendly experiences in all projects that I work on.  When the project is completed I want to be able to continue helping them behind the scenes ensuring that their information is kept safe and secure, and able to reach them quickly, and accurately.  Computational graphics give me the skills to bring vibrant displays to life for a fantastic user experience.  Using these skills I can continue to understand basic layouts and the fundamentals of creating a 2D or 3D scene.
