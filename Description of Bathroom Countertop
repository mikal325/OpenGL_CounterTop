I created a bathroom countertop with a few things that you can expect to see in the bathroom.  There is a hairbrush, hair ties, the sink, the faucet, and a bottle of soap.  
The hairbrush can be seen in the front left corner.  It is made of a box mesh for the brush head and a tapered cylinder mesh for the handle.  
I decided that a wooden hairbrush is cute, so that is why it is made of a wooden texture.  
Below the hairbrush, are three hair ties, made of torus meshes, in a few colors because a girl needs her hair ties to match her outfits, 
and they always get lost, so we need a few hair ties laying around.  In the center of the scene is the bathroom sink.  I created the sink using a sphere mesh, 
and squished it, so it would appear to be an above counter sink.  Behind the sink is the faucet.  The faucet is made of a cylinder mesh, and a cone mesh.  
The cone mesh represents where the water comes out of the faucet.  To the right of the faucet, is a bottle of soap made of a cylinder mesh, that was also squished, 
like a typical bottle of hand soap is shaped like.  The hardest part of programing this scene was the placement of some of my objects, like the hair ties.  
In the front left corner, you can see that one of the hair ties, the grey one, is at an angle and sitting on top of the light blue one.  
Making sure that the grey one was sitting directly on top of the blue one, while not being submerged in the floor, took a few tries to make the scene look real.
Some aspects of the final design were not included, such as the lighting feature and the ability to turn it to orthographic view, with the click of a button.  
However, by pressing the Q,W,E,A,S,D keys on the keyboard you can move the camera up, zoom in, down, left, zoom out, and right respectively.  
Along with being able to change the camera angle by moving the mouse around the scene.  The program should also allow the user to change the speed of the 
movement of camera controls by using the mouses scroll feature.  This program is reusable because every method is commented on, to allow a programmer to 
understand what each function does, and even then, lines of code within the function are also commented to ensure that there is no confusion on what the code does.
